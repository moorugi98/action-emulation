[v4]
roles: primitive, tool, affected
objects: hand, knife, apple
primtives: reach, grasp, cut
use CoI and CoS pair for each verb

[v5]
use relation-based CoS as in Mathis work
This CoS will confirm target and primitive so no need for two seperate nodes for primtiives

Tool is bound first with IoR for testing possibility

[v6]
init prim, tool -> confirm prim, target 
Target is bound based on NEAR objects
worked out reset system
reintroduce CoS for primitives

[v7]
encode tool and target information in color change as well, motivated by the fact that the same object engaged as tool and target will move around differently
this enabled binding tool and target flexibly without fixed order

[v8]
decided to get rid of color coding
use move_toward to form hypotheses about target
wasn't sure of using grasp/drop, added 'manipulate' action changing color of objects

[v9]
noticed that we need one additional field ('reference' in this version)
grasped and dropped as hindsight inference of move_toward-> move_together and move_together->move_away

[10]
New parsing structure using Primitive - Agent - Location - Carried obj

[11]
drop/grasp very simplified, no hindsight inference
